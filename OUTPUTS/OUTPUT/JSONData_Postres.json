But in spite of his misery, he continues to show loyalty to his boss and his endearing family. Pushed by a business-hungry, capitalistic system and a poverty-stricken English slum, poor Mr. Cratchit must struggle in past, present, and future. Yet, the warmth of his loving wife and children make the journey easier and worthwhile. Always patient even driven under the lash by the slave driver, he reminds us all the true humbleness and purity of the human spirit.",

I keep thinking Jake might just show up and say hello, but he never does. I hope wherever he is, he's doin' okay and makin' new friends. I have trouble sleepin' at night. I have bad dreams like I'm falling. I wake up scared. Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am. Maybe I should get me a gun and rob the Foodway so they'd send me home. I could shoot the manager while I was at it, sort of like a bonus. I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense any more. I don't like it here. I'm tired of being afraid all the time.

Clarisse discovered what most never do: the meaning of life. Against a dehumanizing, speedy, totalitarian society, Clarisse longs for early sunrises and morning dew, waving away the long, stretched billboards and speed-hungry passers-by who see brown streaks as cows and green streaks as grass. Poor, darling Clarisse, a most odd being in a futuristic landscape, suffers an untimely end. Why? Because her only crime was being tired of fact-learning in schools; for slowing down the pace just to walk and talk; and for being an individual thinker in a stifling, conforming universe. Yes, Clarisse we wish to go in the abyss with you than continue on in this robotic herd of an existence.",
        "quote": "Have you ever watched the jet cars racing on the boulevards down that way. I sometimes think drivers don't know what grass is, or flowers, because they never see them slowly. If you showed a driver a green blur, Oh yes! he'd say, that's grass! A pink blur! That's a rose garden! White blurs are houses. Brown blurs are cows. My uncle drove slowly on a highway once. He drove at forty miles an hour and they jailed him for two days. Isn't that funny, and sad, too? I rarely watch the 'parlor walls' or go to the races or Fun Parks. So I've lots of time for crazy thoughts, I guess...Bet I know something else you don't. There's dew on the grass in the morning. And if you look there's a man in the moon. My uncle was arrested another time -did I tell you? For being a pedestrian. Oh, we're most peculiar",

Now I could see better than before. It was kind of a natural radar but it was so new it confused me. Then, I met a mysterious man named Stick. I wish the world could know about all the effort, all the long hours, where Stick took a lost and lonely blind kid and taught me to see in ways I never knew existed...He helped me to live up to the nickname when kids would tease me when they thought I was blind and helpless -the Daredevil.

Nevertheless, after an unsuccessful reception the once innocent being turns into a tortured soul reeking destruction and death. So on the poor, soul-torn creature trudges through rugged terrain, reminding us all the shameful behavior of mankind to judge others with their eyes.",

I am full of fears; for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world for ever...They are kind -they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless, and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold a detestable monster.",

To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause: there's the respect That makes calamity of so long life; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office and the spurns hat patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death The undiscover'd country  from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of?

From Chicagoland to the New York area, Humboldt tried with academic seats, political aims, screenplays, and with raising art to a higher level above crass commercialism. But he died a nobody yet succeeded in the one effort all poets aim for: inspiration.",
        "quote": "The Times was much stirred by Humboldt's death and gave him a double-column spread. The photograph was large. For after all Humboldt did what poets in crass America are supposed to do. He chased ruin and death even harder than he had chased women. He blew his talent and his health and reached home, the grave in a dusty slide. He plowed himself under. Okay. So did Edgar Allan Poe, picked out of the Baltimore gutter. And Hart Crane over the side of a ship. And Jarrell falling in front of a car. And poor John Berryman jumping from a bridge. For some reason this awfulness is peculiarly appreciated by business and technological America. The country is proud of its dead poets. It takes terrific satisfaction in the poets' testimony that the USA is too tough, too big, too much, too rugged, that American reality is overpowering. And to be a poet is a school thing, a skirt thing, a church thing.",

Filled with insecurities of personality and appearance, Prufrock ruminates over his sad, middle-aged indecisions. He tries hard to dare the universe in consummating a romantic relationship but he admits that he's no Prince Hamlet, no prophet, and here is no great matter. Educated and alone, Prufrock looks out at the scene of things, never being a part of it. Through cityscapes of drains and smoky haze, measuring his life in coffee spoons, Prufrock shows us the modern, 20th century Western individual as an isolated, lost figure in human history.",

We don't know his story but we connect with its themes of weariness, unhappiness, and loneliness; the same life themes that springs from lost loves, failed jobs, abandoned cots, monotonous hours, empty pockets, starved hopes...And yet instead of wallowing in self-pity, art is produced, music is played. And we accept this as a lasting artifact of the human condition.",

The poor, hapless soldier lad, who paraded in violent platoons and infantries, an infant himself, sadly endures mornings that melt into evenings with meal breaks of rum and despair.

He soon forgets his strife and becomes engulfed in the merry hum of bee, the feathery snow, the fountain's brink, the fresh, sylvan air, the fringe of summer flowers, the rain that glazed the snow, the massy trunks cased in pure crystal...",

The sunshine on my path/Was to me as a friend. The swelling hills,/The quiet dells retiring far between,/With gentle invitation to explore/Their windings, were a calm society/That talked with me and soothed me. Then the chant/Of birds, and chime of brooks, and soft caress/Of the fresh sylvan air, made me forget/The thoughts that broke my peace, and I began/To gather simples by the fountain's brink,/And lose myself in day-dreams.",

A revolutionary at heart, a romantic deep within, we no longer question if a fist, a jab, a hook, a kick is a harder blow than the heart and mind. With Sun Bak on the frontlines, there indeed is nothing more mightier than the meek. And fighting for the nameless and faceless, the meek together can inherit the earth",

Only a few of you understood. The rest of you put on black and sat in Chapel. Why do you come here? Why do you dress your hypocrisy in black and parade before your God on Sunday? From love? No. For you have shown that your hearts are too withered to receive the love of your Divine Father. I know why you have come - I have seen it in your faces Sunday after Sunday as I've stood here before you. Fear has brought you here. Horrible, superstitious fear.

But for now, she fights on against the villains of the world, joining an assembly of other heroes. Acrobatic in moves, astute in martial arts, keen in spy tactics, Black Widow makes peace with her situation and her nature.

He just carries rejections, frustrations, defeats, and so carries the hearts of millions just like him: naive, cynical, hapless sometimes, excited other times. We quietly root for this underdog. We want him to win the feat, beat the odds, stand tall and mighty before the crowds - just once. But we know Life dealt him and us a different hand and he never wins.

He comes to see the inevitable end of all humans, the threshold crossed and never returned. He learns the transience of it all, the vanity of all works and acts. And through this catharsis, studying the abyss, his pride shatters. With such revelation what worth can there be to hold grudges, that our visit on earth is too short for pointless trifles where wronged and wrongdoer end in the same fate. Yes, the speaker broke his pride and forgave, finding it better to sink in the grave with brotherly, neighborly spirit than burdened with pointless petty earthly cares.",
        "quote": "Where, pondering how all human love and hate/ Find one sad level; and how, soon or late,/ Wronged and wrongdoer, each with meekened face,/ And cold hands folded over a still heart,/ Pass the green threshold of our common grave,/ Whither all footsteps tend, whence none depart,/ Awed for myself, and pitying my race,/ Our common sorrow, like a mighty wave,/ Swept all my pride away, and trembling I forgave!",

He uses the nightingale as a symbol of a better world, far past and beyond the death and pain in purity and song. He even wishes to flee with the nightingale away from the race of men in the very essence of Poetry. So long has he brooded and romanticized Death itself. Rising and falling, ebbing and flowing in wonderment, anticipation, weariness and longing, the speaker pours onto the bird a soulful introspection. But reality kicks in and the dream ends. But it seems a part of the speaker may have flown away.",
        "quote": "Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget/ What thou among the leaves hast never known,/ The weariness, the fever, and the fret/ Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;/ Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,/ Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;/ Where but to think is to be full of sorrow/ And leaden-eyed despairs,/ Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,/ Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.",

Everyone around filled with purpose, life, bounty, busy enjoying life, the speaker finds himself naked in atomic nullity with no place to go, nothing to do, no one for him. Stripped of all worldly things he thinks of himself as a newborn -mute, dumb, empty- and the pain of such emptiness transmutes to confusion, frustration, restlessness. He drifts on nowhere like the waves and wind. All in stark contrast to everyone else he seems to be dying in the lost days and time. But the anguished speaker learns a valuable lesson that in his emptiness he nourishes on something of the soul, gaining true enlightenment.",

Yet sadly no one shares in his momentous wonder of flower and sun. As he stands still all around are people coming and going, no one staying, no one stopping or glancing back: no smile, no song, no look of eye, no human exchange. And later he rests at the scorn of his acquaintances who too do not care for the passing scene and moment. The speaker is a tender, sensitive creature embracing the delicious presence, here and now. He even finds that the journey is neither hard nor long when you walk in the spirit of all things, destined for a human rendezvous.",

Her lullaby, melodic, tranquil voice carries an accepting understanding as if she seen it all -the mystery of the cosmos, the eventuality of all things, the very face of God.

Sephora even reminds us of the true, pure love and faith of strong willed people with good values.
