And all the while a gossiping town that never forgives or forgets keeps humming the same, sad refrain: "poor Emily, poor Emily."

So when it was time for Emily to be carried off after the bygone of generations, the china-painter becomes a bride to death itself.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The lonely young woman caught in the rain on a night street. Thought to be a worthless derelict, a perfect specimen for a newly concocted poison, the girl proves otherwise. With a hard-luck story of a three-month jail sentence, for petty larceny, an invalid husband recently deceased, and current destitution, meekness held the form of a brunette wrapped in a raincoat. When cynicism should be her only outlet, she reminds us the beauties of life: spring mornings, summer nights, music, art, love, and the little kindness that makes a sad, blundering world beautiful again. </DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>One misbegotten mistake, one shameful sin and a vivacious, lovely young woman is lowered into a pale and drab existence. Never smiles or sunshine to welcome her, just a scaffold's shadow and somber sadness to walk beside her. Poor, hapless Hester survives rather than lives from day to day during the religious, stern epoch of Puritan close-mindedness. Despite her situation, she gives to others as alms to the poor and nurse to the sick -never wanting reward or acknowledgement. So on through the burden of years, the gray adorned ghost of a woman, alienated life as a social outcast, an ex-husband casting revenge, a possessed daughter reeking havoc, the embrodierer continues on. We shudder to think she will carry a joyless soul and earthly woe to a dark grave.  </DESCRIPTION>

Humboldt carried within him all the creative energy, intellectualism, and passion that a human being could contain in one skull. After one great publication, he continued in the career of letters but struggled through relationships, finances, friendships. From Chicagoland to the New York area, Humboldt tried with academic seats, political aims, screenplays, and with raising art to a higher level above crass commercialism. But he died a nobody yet succeeded in the one effort all poets aim for: inspiration.</DESCRIPTION>

Educated and alone, Prufrock looks out at the scene of things, never being a part of it. Through cityscapes of drains and smoky haze, measuring his life in coffeespoons, Prufrock shows us the modern, 20th century Western individual as an isolated, lost figure in human history.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>The innocently pure darling used by the rogues of this world, misused by a weary Southern mother, then abused by a sad turn of events. Poor Lucynell, born deaf and mute, thought she found something to hope for but see it racing away toward the horizon. The sweet, gentle daughter who in the end was just a heavy burden to those closest to her. A rather large young woman close to thirty delighted just to learn how to pronounce "bird." Yet, what reward comes to such meek beauty but a haphazard marriage and careless abandonment in a road side diner. Truly, this misunderstood, unknowing creature was an Angel of God for possessing human frailty in its rich, quiet essence.</DESCRIPTION>

With a beautiful mind teeming with ideals of individuality, beauty, and the human spirit, the soul-torn Marilyn adamantly and blatantly declines an operation of generic beauty. But the eighteen-year old, inspired by a father who fought long and hard for his dignity, sadly loses the battle to convice an automaton world the worth of foreign thoughts and feelings. Yet even though her beliefs are now voiced from a collective conscience, a body now tucked underneath an assembly line figure, we still hear echoes of a rebel crying out.</DESCRIPTION>

    <DESCRIPTION>Torn between avenging a murdered father, reconciling an unfaithful mother and impious girlfriend, the young intellectual prince of Denmark meets his tragedy. Hamlet, clothed entirely in black, lingers in black thoughts, with a black future of seiges and death. Continuously in meditative monologues, the vacillating prince struggles with his decision. He sees clearly the futility of it all, the emptiness that all flesh returns to. So all the time, Hamlet longs for the eternal sleep where at the last is answered: to be or not to be?</DESCRIPTION>

For we all could see the mariner, the weary, stranded, drifting lost soul in the depths of a wide sea. We all pushed on in the dark, all alone, hoping to find that harbor of friendship and love.

Mute and longing, he drowns in the darkness but still hopes while sinking into the limitless deep -a fire that no water could put out.</DESCRIPTION>

Nothing of interest catches his eye. No angry or joyous thought changes his expression. He just sits and states in somber brooding. His epic silence and mysterious looks seems to imbibe all the throe and woe of the human condition, of human thought and feeling, and does so loud and clear.</DESCRIPTION>
