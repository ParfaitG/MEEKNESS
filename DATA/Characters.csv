1,Al Borland,"The lovable, good-natured co-host of Tool Time whose work with his hands has won him a place in people's hearts; a sensitive, amiable man in stark contrast to the stereotypical male of touch masculinity and proud chauvinism. At times, Al struggles to keep a steady woman relationship and his lifestyles and manners make him an unpopular, dull creature among others. Nonetheless, with his caring, innocent nature, the humble Al has proven America to be the everyman, the nice guy who finishes last, the underdog.",,AlBorland.jpg
2,Al Bundy,"The popular shoe salesman who made America laugh because of a lackluster life he led after high school; a hapless man who never got what he wanted which was to play football. Instead, he works for a minimum-wage job that he hates to provide for a family that disrespects him. When able to reverse his dreadful, downtrodden situation, he never seems to win, or make it happen or come out on top. So while the aging, relic endures a dissatisfying existence he gives comfort to ever average, low-paid American who almost won the big one.","I fight honking traffic just for the privilege of putting cheap shoes onto the cloven hooves of people like you. I'll never play football like I wanted to. I'll never know the touch of a beautiful woman. And I'll never know the joy of driving through the city without a bag over my head. But I'm not a loser. Because, despite it all, me and every other guy who'll never be what they wanted to be, is out there, being what we don't want to be, forty hours a week, for life. And the fact that I haven't put a gun in my mouth, you pudding of a woman, makes me a winner!",AlBundy.jpg
3,Alyosha,"The stable-minded, loving novice in a Russian monastery, Alyosha finds close mentorship with the monastic elder, Zosima, and love from feuding school boys. Caught in a clashing family struggle over finances and lust, Alyosha continues his honest, religious, caring ways -leading by example.

This little known young man turned a family name of madness and violence completely around for kindness and humanity, testimony that meekness is a powerful trait.",,Alyosha.jpg
4,Arthur Dimmesdale,"The New England minister with sad, weary eyes and a steady hand over his heart. Pained by a sinful act, Arthur Dimmesdale walks the earth sick and scared of a lost reputation and redemptive God. He lacks the courage to reveal himself. Through profound liturgies and lessons he feels the hard weight of a Puritan society. As his accomplice in crime carries her shame openly, Reverend Dimmesdale tortures his red mark in secret. But open to human eyes, Arthur finally gushes out what was so long kept dormant underneath. His boulder of pain kept him the meek lamb he so long preached about.","I, whom you behold in these black garments of the priesthood,–I, who ascend the sacred desk, and turn my pale face heavenward, taking upon myself to hold communion, in your behalf, with the Most High Omniscience,–I, in whose daily life you discern the sanctity of Enoch,–I, whose footsteps, as you suppose, leave a gleam along my earthly track, whereby the pilgrims that shall come after me may be guided to the regions of the blest,–I, who have laid the hand of baptism upon your children,–I, who have breathed the parting prayer over your dying friends, to whom the Amen sounded faintly from a world which they had quitted,–I, your pastor, whom you so reverence and trust, am utterly a pollution and a lie!",ArthurDimmesdale.jpg
5,Athlete Dying Young,"The smart lad who dodged and hurdled the vanity of the world. No laurels to crown, no records to beat, this athletic specimen cut early down in life is better for it. His soul will now feed on eternal salvation away from the Barmecidal feast and crowds, cheers, trophies, and tokens. We find it a sad sight for young talent to diminish. We hurt to see a town's beacon to be stunted and uprooted in its blossoming. But we learn of the brief garland, the withering laurel, the fading name, but also meek souls who flourish far from earthly fame and fortune.","Smart lad, to slip betimes away/From fields where glory does not stay,/And early though the laurel grows/It withers quicker than the rose./Eyes the shady night has shut/Cannot see the record cut/And silence sounds no worse than cheers/After earth has stopped the ears:/Now you will not swell the rout/Of lads that wore their honours out,/Runners whom renown outran/And the name died before the man",AthleteDying.jpg
6,Barney Gumble,"The middle-aged town drunk who lives a loveless, aimless life on a bar stool. For whatever reason, Barney's childhood promise dissolved away into a bottle. We see the antics and the jokes. We hear the dull voice and long burps. But we imbibe a lonely, soulful creature who would like a sober way out. As addiction mounts through the years, as Springfield passes along its events, as times progresses, Barney, somebody's best friend, a bar owner's steady customer, will be sure to keep his rightful post. But that doesn't mean the end of the dreaming, of the hoping; and we admit he had not yet died.","My name is Barney Gumble. I'm forty, I'm single, and I drink. There's a line in Othello about a drinker: 'Now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast.' That pretty well covers it. Don't cry for me, I'm already dead.",Barney.jpg
7,Bartleby,"The stoic, mysterious clerk of a Wall Street law office who lives and dies alone. Familyless, friendless, Bartleby lives as a frozen sentinel through his existence. When commanded by a boss, beseeched by co-workers, urged by strangers, Bartleby gives the usual refrain: ""I prefer not to."" Eventually, he is fired; eventually, he is homeless; eventually, he starves to death. No one knows the how or why. But this unknown scrivener evokes some trait of humanity, some element of suffering and endurance. And we pause to take in his message in the silence of our hearts.","He remained as ever, a fixture in my chamber. Nay–if that were possible–he became still more of a fixture than before. What was to be done? He would do nothing in the office: why should he stay there? In plain fact, he had now become a millstone to me, not only useless as a necklace, but afflictive to bear. Yet I was sorry for him. I speak less than truth when I say that, on his own account, he occasioned me uneasiness. If he would but have named a single relative or friend, I would instantly have written, and urged their taking the poor fellow away to some convenient retreat. But he seemed alone, absolutely alone in the universe. A bit of wreck in the mid Atlantic.",Bartleby.jpg
8,Belle,"The sympathetic maiden who tamed a ruthless beast. From modest origins in a small town, Belle sacrificed herself for a father's welfare. Caught in an enchanted castle with intolerant, vigilante townspeople, Belle fights for virtue. For anyone who thinks outer beauty is not the manifestation of inner beauty, behold this lovely, gentle being. An avid reader, an outspoken young woman with ideas, Belle shines light on a dark kingdom, casting off spells, turning gargoyles into angels, and a beast into a human. She even shows the story of love can be new and vibrant and not a tale as old as time.",,Belle.jpg
9,Bernard,"The bookish nerd of a friend who showed how responsibility and diligence in his schoolwork can lead to success years later. Bernard was liked but not well liked in high school. He suffered the burdens of false values where men are judged by reputation and popularity among peers, while others, himself included, fall by the wayside as nobodys. Yet, the poor hardworking Bernard endured his unpopularity and the cruel mockery for his anemic, worrisome personality. Eventually, this small iota of a man rose up in status and significance from a dissed, weak kid to an important lawyer arguing a case to the Supreme Court. In the end, his childhood nightmare woke up to the American Dream. ",,Bernard.jpg
10,Bigger Thomas,"A restless, uneducated twenty-year old black male whose life's story was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Crawling out from the lower rung of the social ladder in the cramped constriction of Chicago's South Side, poor Bigger Thomas has been limited all his life by the white man in all thinking, feeling, and doing. Never the hard-core animal prevalent in most ruthless serial killers or hopeless, indifferent man who has nothing to lose, Bigger only wanted was denied him: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Instead, he was doomed to a six-by-four prison cell and an electric chair.","Mr. Max, I sort of saw myself after that night. And I sort of saw other people, too. Well, it's sort of funny, Mr. Max. I ain't trying to dodge what's coming to me. I know I'm going to get it. I'm going to die. Well, that's all right now. But really I never wanted to hurt nobody. That's the truth, Mr. Max. I hurt folks 'cause I felt I had to; that's all. They was crowding me too close; they wouldn't give me no room. Lots of times I tried to forget 'em, but I couldn't. They wouldn't let me. Mr. Max, I didn't mean to do what I did. I was trying to do something else. But it seems I never could. I was always wanting something and I was feeling that nobody would let me have it. So I fought 'em. I thought they was hard and I acted hard. But I ain't hard, Mr. Max. I ain't hard even a little bit.",BiggerThomas.jpg
11,Billy Pilgrim,"A weak boy soldier who in later years meets an alien race that opens up to him the truth of measured time. Back and forth Billy relives the nonlinear progression of his life, seeing his family members', his acquaintances', and his own death countless times. He even witnesses the purple realm of Death itself and no longer fears it. With a sensitive heart bleeding at sights of a starved war horse, homeless bums on rail cars, a phone operator on the opposite end, Billy continues on or so it goes. Yet he teaches us all to live life in moments and not timeline events in chronology.",,BillyPilgrim.jpg
12,Bleeding Gums Murphy,"The middle-aged saxophonist who mentors a talented, young protégé, but sadly carries the weight of the world on his shoulders. Poor, hapless Bleeding Gums Murphy once a highly successful recording artist, now suffers the pangs of depleted funds and lost stardom. Now, the jazz man roams alleys, streets, and bridges attempting to bring out of dark nights the living entity of art and music. Sadly, the soul-torn musician passes away dying like he lived: unremembered and unloved. Yet ultimately, Bleeding Gums shows us all the painful beauty of transforming life's woes into tender lyrics and heartfelt notes that last beyond lifetimes; and how the blues is the crying anthem of the meek.","Oh, I'm so lonely,/Since my baby left me./I got no money,/And nothing is free./Oh, I been so lonely,/Since the day I was born./All I got is this rusty,/This rusty old horn.",BleedingGums.jpg

I have bad dreams like I'm falling. I wake up scared. Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am. Maybe I should get me a gun and rob the Foodway so they'd send me home. I could shoot the manager while I was at it, sort of like a bonus. I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense any more. I don't like it here. I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided not to stay. I doubt they'll kick up any fuss. Not for an old crook like me.",BrooksHatlen.jpg

Green- was plastered on a nine-line newspaper print of this thirty-five year old suicidal.

Was never there with Drake's men in the evening when the sails stood in from the Americas! Was never there beneath the Spaniard's swarthy eye at Vincent's Cape! Was never there in the red-oak thicket in the morning! Was never there to hear the war-cries round the Painted Buttes! No, no. He was no voyager of unknown seas, no pioneer of western trails. He was life's little man, life's nameless cypher, life's man-swarm atom, life's American--and now he lies disjected and exploded on a street in Brooklyn!",CGreen.jpg

Ho, ho! from all your furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee.

Bred from an upper class life, poor Carlton never quite settled in social circles; never quite felt the continual fond embrace of a girl; never quite belonged to the close network of cliques. Somewhat snobby, Carlton nevertheless symbolizes the sad penalty of success; how even the good and honest never win in the late 20th century America. However, Carlton whose taste in popular culture usually are at odds with his peers, always exhibits a vivacious spirit that remains eternally aflame despite being denied social belonging.","You think I'm a sellout... Why? Because I live in a big house where I dress a certain way? Or maybe it's because I like Barry Manilow?...Being black isn't what I'm trying to be, it's what I am.

I sometimes think drivers don't know what grass is, or flowers, because they never see them slowly. If you showed a driver a green blur, Oh yes! he'd say, that's grass! A pink blur! That's a rose garden! White blurs are houses. Brown blurs are cows. My uncle drove slowly on a highway once. He drove at forty miles an hour and they jailed him for two days. Isn't that funny, and sad, too? I rarely watch the 'parlor walls' or go to the races or Fun Parks. So I've lots of time for crazy thoughts, I guess...Bet I know something else you don't.

The young Emmeline always wrote poetry, tender heartfelt lays and tributes to any recently deceased living form.

A honest, modest hero and innocent spirit who only wanted love from a tender mother, a stubborn lieutenant, and especially a childhood sweetheart. In the end, he made us taste the sweetness of life's delicious and at times unknown chocolate.",,ForrestGump.jpg
37,Frankenstein monster,"A horrible-looking progeny of a maddened, ambitious scientist who embodies the very spirit of benevolence and love. Deformed in an ugly appearance on a juggernaut frame, the monster, nameless and unloved, sets his foot on a world he seldom understands. But finding a restful heaven in a dark hovel away from scornful, prejudiced men, the creature learns the beauty of all humanity from simple cottagers. Nevertheless, after an unsuccessful reception the once innocent being turns into a tortured soul reeking destruction and death. So on the poor, soul-torn creature trudges through rugged terrain, reminding us all the shameful behavior of mankind to judge others with their eyes.","I am an unfortunate and deserted creature; I look around, and I have no relation or friend upon earth. These amiable people to whom I go have never seen me, and know little of me. I am full of fears; for if I fail there, I am an outcast in the world for ever...They are kind -they are the most excellent creatures in the world; but, unfortunately, they are prejudiced against me. I have good dispositions; my life has been hitherto harmless, and in some degree beneficial; but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes, and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend, they behold a detestable monster.",FrankensteinMonster.jpg
38,Fredo Corleone,"Fumbling at the most inopportune times, Fredo is last in line in the Corleone family -even being ousted by a kid brother. Fighting for respect, Fredo always loses. Yet he stays dutiful in the family business. But inadequacies torment him as his helpless father dies on a curb next to him. Given peripheral enterprises to run, Fredo manages but in the scheming and politics he crosses the line. Then, a wife mockes him openly, feeding fire to his self-pity. At last a quiet lake on a dusky fishing scene, his sad life ends. Yet a family still talks of him, proving one can die but not perish.",,FredoCorleone.jpg
39,Gart Williams,"An ad agency exec caught in the a push-push-push business where he must rush-rush-rush through life. Everyday poor Gart Williams is forced to compete in an inhuman existence for profit and speed. Then, an unsympathetic wife adds to the overwhelming burden for her sensitive, soul-torn husband. At last, grabbing a few moments of respite, hapless Gart finds serenity and solace in a dream-contrived place called Willoughby. After exasperating days and a lifetime of stress and ulcers, Gart years for this peaceful, summertime 19th century paradise. Sadly such a haven is out of reach, leaving Gart to ask the untimely question: will it be?","I would prefer, though never asked before, a job, any job at all where I could be myself. Where I wouldn't have to climb on a stage and go through a masquerade every morning at nine o'clock. And mouth all the dialogue and play the executive and make believe I'm the bright young man who's on his way up 'cause I'm not that person, Janey. You've tried to make me that person but that isn't me. That isn't me at all...I know where I'd like to be...Willoughby. It was summer, very warm. Kids were barefooted. One of them had a fishing pole. It all looked like a Currier and Ives painting. Bandstand, bicycles, wagons. I've never seen such serenity. It was the way people must have lived a hundred years ago. Crazy dream.",GartWilliams.jpg
40,Gerty MacDowell,"The sorrow-faced, Irish dame lovely who shows us on a balmy, summer even the surreal capacity of tenderness and love. A solitude young lady caught up in a marriage no more than its title and name finds her very dream of love dressed in black. With a soul moved to embrace pain and stand up as companion through Earth's dark matter, Gerty, who too knows the burden of a nameless sandess, gives to us a pair of sentimental eyes, a lame gait, and jilted but tender spirit. And presents to us at last how beauty itself can climb down from its high pedestal and walk among the peopled earth as a foreigner and comforter.","He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given worlds to know what it was...The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her. There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls, unfeminine, he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn't got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.",GertyMacDowell.jpg
41,"Girl, Monsieur Verdoux","The lonely young woman caught in the rain on a night street. Thought to be a worthless derelict, a perfect specimen for a newly concocted poison, the girl proves otherwise. With a hard-luck story of a three-month jail sentence, for petty larceny, an invalid husband recently deceased, and current destitution, meekness held the form of a brunette wrapped in a raincoat. When cynicism should be her only outlet, she reminds us the beauties of life: spring mornings, summer nights, music, art, love, and the little kindness that makes a sad, blundering world beautiful again. ","Yet life is wonderful. Everything. Spring morning, summer night, music, art, love...[Love is] giving, sacrificing, the same a mother feels for a child...[My husband] was wounded in the war, a hopeless invalid. That's why I loved him. He needed me, depended on me, he was like a child. But he was more than a child to me; he was a religion, my very breath. I would have killed for him. No, love is something very real and deep...I don't know why I'm carrying on like this. I was beginning to lose faith in everything and this happens and you want to believe all over again...it's a blundering world, and a very sad one; yet a little kindness can it beautiful.",GirlMonsieurVerdoux.jpg
42,H.E.R.,"The personified symbol of a music movement, of a subculture for disenfranchised youth, of a righteous resistance to mainstream norms. Nevertheless, H.E.R. becomes tainted by gangster and thug personalities. From a proud beacon of Afrocentricity to a ghetto-fabulous thing-piece commercialized for mass appeal, we see a beautiful, black heroine fallen by the wayside and shrunk to a defiled creature. Oh, the two decade dissolution of something hopeful! Oh, the art disintegrated to the bare facts of life! Oh, the beauty, rhythm, social consciousness never realized!",,HER.jpg
43,Hamlet,"Torn between avenging a murdered father, reconciling an unfaithful mother and impious girlfriend, the young intellectual prince of Denmark meets his tragedy. Hamlet, clothed entirely in black, lingers in black thoughts, with a black future of sieges and death. Continuously in meditative monologues, the vacillating prince struggles with his decision. He sees clearly the futility of it all, the emptiness that all flesh returns to. So all the time, Hamlet longs for the eternal sleep where at the last is answered: to be or not to be?","To be, or not to be: that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep; No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep; To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub; For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, Must give us pause: there's the respect That makes calamity of so long life; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, The insolence of office and the spurns hat patient merit of the unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, But that the dread of something after death The undiscover'd country  from whose bourn No traveller returns, puzzles the will And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? Thus conscience does make cowards of us all",Hamlet.jpg
44,Hannah,"The tenacious, flower growing out of the smoky muddiness of a Jewish ghetto; a noble, brave woman who tried hard to fight a corrupt and cruel system. Poor Hannah who grew up scrubbing kitchen floors and tending laundry still has a lovely soul to dream pure, honest aspirations. For all she wanted was a chance to a live in an uncertain future on a green countryside with a chicken farm with growing grapes and apples. Yet iron heels too quickly stomped on this war-torn daffodil whose sweet tears have shown the world the awful, sour chapter in human history. Nonetheless, her frank spirit shines like a beloved star too far for foul mankind to ever reach. ","Hannah, can you hear me? Wherever you are, look up Hannah! The clouds are lifting! The sun is breaking through! We are coming out of the darkness into the light! We are coming into a new world; a kindlier world, where men will rise above their hate, their greed, and brutality. Look up, Hannah! The soul of man has been given wings and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow! Into the light of hope, into the future! The glorious future, that belongs to you, to me and to all of us. Look up, Hannah. Look up!",Hannah.jpg
45,Henry Corwin,"Far from the jolly optimism of St. Nick, poor Henry Corwin, a purposeless relic, works as a department story Santa Clause. Sadly the Yuletide festivities force Henry to find solace in a bottle since the miserable, alcoholic drunk must witness day in and day out the drab, dirty hopelessness of poverty all around him and people who forget the charity and purity of Christmas. He must with an aching heart look upon destitute children whose only Christmas presents are unrequited hopes. Nonetheless, Henry lands upon a mysterious bag which gives each poor slum child their heart's desires. So a compassionate soul who felt helpless to shabby conditions becomes a great, grand gift giver to the meek.","I don't know how to tell you Mr. Dundee. I don't know at all. All I know is that I'm an aging, purposeless relic of another time and I live in a dirty rooming house on a street filled with hungry kids and shabby people where the only thing that comes down the chimney on Christmas Eve is more poverty! You know another reason why I drink Mr. Dundee? So that when I walk down the tenements I can really think it is the North Pole and the children are elves and I'm really Santa Claus bringing them a bag of wondrous gifts for all of them! I just wish Mr. Dundee just one Christmas–.Only ONE–.that I could see some of the hopeless  ones, and the dreamless ones, just on one Christmas, I'd like to see the meek inherit the Earth, and that is why I drink Mr. Dundee and that is why I weep.",HenryCorwin.jpg
46,Hester Prynne,"One misbegotten mistake, one shameful sin and a vivacious, lovely young woman is lowered into a pale and drab existence. Never smiles or sunshine to welcome her, just a scaffold's shadow and somber sadness to walk beside her. Poor, hapless Hester survives rather than lives from day to day during the religious, stern epoch of Puritan close-mindedness. Despite her situation, she gives to others as alms to the poor and nurse to the sick -never wanting reward or acknowledgement. So on through the burden of years, the gray adorned ghost of a woman, alienated life as a social outcast, an ex-husband casting revenge, a possessed daughter reeking havoc, the embroiderer continues on. We shudder to think she will carry a joyless soul and earthly woe to a dark grave.  ",,HesterPrynne.jpg
47,Holden Caufield,"The seventeen-year old dropout from Pencey Prep who becomes the voice of teenage America; the soul-torn young man caught in the world of hypocrisy and superficiality. Sadly, Holden is unreachable by teachers, psychiatrists, or others alike for his gloomy, misanthropic, and cynical nature that forces him into alienation. His sensitivity and intelligence makes him distrustful of the adult world. Only does the playful laughter of children, in their innocent and genuine ways, intrigue his heart and fancy. We can scarcely imagine this depressed youth can still dream especially a pure one of protecting children in fields of rye and from falling off a cliff.","Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around - nobody big, I mean - except me. And I'm standing on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff - I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be.",HoldenCaufield.jpg
48,Humboldt,"The insomniac, manic depressive poet who lived and died like all American poets are supposed to: a brief moment in the sun and squalid, secluded years to follow. Humboldt carried within him all the creative energy, intellectualism, and passion that a human being could contain in one skull. After one great publication, he continued in the career of letters but struggled through relationships, finances, friendships. From Chicagoland to the New York area, Humboldt tried with academic seats, political aims, screenplays, and with raising art to a higher level above crass commercialism. But he died a nobody yet succeeded in the one effort all poets aim for: inspiration.","The Times was much stirred by Humboldt's death and gave him a double-column spread. The photograph was large. For after all Humboldt did what poets in crass America are supposed to do. He chased ruin and death even harder than he had chased women. He blew his talent and his health and reached home, the grave in a dusty slide. He plowed himself under. Okay. So did Edgar Allan Poe, picked out of the Baltimore gutter. And Hart Crane over the side of a ship. And Jarrell falling in front of a car. And poor John Berryman jumping from a bridge. For some reason this awfulness is peculiarly appreciated by business and technological America. The country is proud of its dead poets. It takes terrific satisfaction in the poets' testimony that the USA is too tough, too big, too much, too rugged, that American reality is overpowering. And to be a poet is a school thing, a skirt thing, a church thing.",Humboldt.jpg
49,J. Alfred Prufrock,"The quintessential modern man sweltering in the stifled existence of urban living. Filled with insecurities of personality and appearance, Prufrock ruminates over his sad, middle-aged indecisions. He tries hard to dare the universe in consummating a romantic relationship but he admits that he's no Prince Hamlet, no prophet, and here is no great matter. Educated and alone, Prufrock looks out at the scene of things, never being a part of it. Through cityscapes of drains and smoky haze, measuring his life in coffee spoons, Prufrock shows us the modern, 20th century Western individual as an isolated, lost figure in human history.","And indeed there will be time/To wonder, ""Do I dare?"" and, ""Do I dare?""/Time to turn back and descend the stair,/With a bald spot in the middle of my hair""/[They will say: ""How his hair is growing thin!""]/My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,/My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin""/[They will say: ""But how his arms and legs are thin!""]/Do I dare/Disturb the universe?/In a minute there is time/For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse./For I have known them all already, known them all:–/Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,/I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;/I know the voices dying with a dying fall/Beneath the music from a farther room./So how should I presume?",JAlfredPrufrock.jpg
50,James Evans,"Everyday he is busting and scratching for food on the table, a roof over head, opportunities for his three children. But everyday, the 1970s Chicago South Side gives no helping hand as the working class father must work two grueling jobs just to get the bare crumbs called hope. Mired in a recession, walled in by poverty, the proud James epitomizes the strong, black man. Sometimes a hopeful job or chance comes along only to prove impossible or inconvenient. But still he continues surviving the only way he knows how: somehow, someway.","A job? What the hell good is a job? Man, I got a job. I got two jobs. Hell, I had jobs all my life. I want something more for my son. I want him to have an opportunity and you and I both know opportunities only come through with an education.",JamesEvans.jpg
51,Jay Gatsby,"The Long Island millionaire who hosts lavish weekly parties in his luxurious home but never partook in the festivities. From meager origins, Jay Gatsby shunned poverty and hungered for wealth even if it meant bootlegging and securities fraud. Jay, a creature of his time, got caught in the rapture of the brimming 20s and the bustling New York. He even gets lovestruck along the way for an old flame. Blinded by it all, Jay Gatsby faces accidents and death but deep down he was just a lost boy looking for respect and love. His near empty funeral reveals the Great Gatsby is just a meek Gatsby.",You see I usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there trying to forget the sad things that happened to me.,JayGatsby.jpg

Jerry holds steadfast in a private school filled with intimidating figures from peer to teacher. Going against the tide, daring the universe, hanging onto his principles, Jerry refuses to sell chocolates. So the torment intensifies. Brawls erupt as he tastes blood and broken teeth, as fists rain down its fury on him. A David against a Goliath, courage gains a face and heart with this young man. Jerry even teaches a close friend that they can beat him up but can't beat him.","Just now, Janza was beating me up. But he wasn't winning. I mean, you can get beat up and still not lose. You can look like a loser but don't have to be one. Janza's the loser, Goober. He'll be a loser all his life. He beat me up but he couldn't beat me. They want you to fight, Goober. And you can really lose only if you fight them. That's what the goons want. And guys like Archie Costello. You have to outlast them, that's all.",JerryRenault.jpg
53,Jim Casey,"The ex-preacher who took to the road with a family toward California. Jim made a few graces over meals, a few prayers over the dead but his heart was no longer in the established faith. Out of the church now, the wandering middle-aged man roams the abandoned countryside in search of a calling. Alone, sad, lost Jim finds his purpose among the people. Hot in human strife, he is arrested by the police but after enlisting in a worthy cause. Still believing the holy spirit is the human spirit and that all people are part of one big soul, Jim finds everyday things holy.","I'll go anyways. Somepin's happening. I went up an' I looked, an' the houses is all empty, an' the lan' is empty, an' this whole country is empty. I can't stay here no more. I got to go where the folks is goin'.

Away on a wigwam and raft, Jim and his companion become entangled with the worst characters the world has to offer. But through a caring heart, bleeding with homesickness for his family, the Negro runaway slave finds his way to freedom. Always a practical as well as superstitious man, the self-denying Jim welcomes in open arms a young friend who crosses the color barrier, the shackle's long chain, and the vigilante mob's fast pursuit during America's darkest, merciless chapters.","Pooty soon I'll be a-shout'n for joy, en I'll say, it's all on accounts o' Huck; I's a free man, en I couldn't ever ben free ef it hadn't ben for Huck; Huck done it.

56,Job,"Where before rigidly-endowed cattle and a rich, loving family walked with him hand in hand, now a barren home and a diseased body oppresses his soul. The biblical figure, Job, with a truly faithful heart nonetheless remains pious and upright to his God. Despite his god-fearing nature though, poor, hapless Job, once an oriental chieftain whose name echoed throughout the East, cries out with such bleeding anguish for the ultimate reasoning behind his suffering. In the end, his story becomes the heroic sage of the human condition, turning tragedy into triumph because he disregarded things of this world.","There the wicked cease from turmoil, and there the weary are at rest./Captives also enjoy their ease; they no longer hear the slave driver's shout./The small and the great are there, and the slaves are freed from their owners./Why is light given to those in misery,and life to the bitter of soul,/to those who long for death that does not come, who search for it more than for hidden treasure,/who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave?/Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?/For sighing has become my daily food; my groans pour out like water./What I feared has come upon me; what I dreaded has happened to me./I have no peace, no quietness; I have no rest, but only turmoil.",Job.jpg

John Coffey of somewhat sub-average intelligence but superhuman size possesses the miraculous gift of healing. Sadly this calm, mild, innocent inmate dies on the electric chair but his humble yet hapless spirit roams beyond cell blocks and prison wards into the hearts and minds of feeling souls. Even if he is the lonely sparrow in the rain, he beckons all earth's inhabitants with all his childlike personality to be happy on a loving planet.","You tell God the Father it was a kindness you done. I know you hurtin' and worryin', I can feel it on you, but you oughta quit on it now. Because I want it over and done. I do. I'm tired, boss. Tired of bein' on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. Tired of not ever having me a buddy to be with, or tell me where we's coming from or going to, or why.

Poor Laura limited by her own self-consciousness sadly drops out of high school and business school. Now, the kind-faced, meek lady spends her time in an illusionary world waiting for a gentleman caller to take her away. But eventually, the lame daughter and sister learns the beauty of imperfections; where all the world are duplicated horses, she is the unique unicorn; where all the world are weeds, she is blue roses.","I wish that you were my sister. I'd teach you to have some confidence in yourself. The different people are not like other people, but being different is nothing to be ashamed of. Because other people are not such wonderful people.

Poor Lucynell, born deaf and mute, thought she found something to hope for but see it racing away toward the horizon. The sweet, gentle daughter who in the end was just a heavy burden to those closest to her. A rather large young woman close to thirty delighted just to learn how to pronounce ""bird.""

With a beautiful mind teeming with ideals of individuality, beauty, and the human spirit, the soul-torn Marilyn adamantly and blatantly declines an operation of generic beauty. But the eighteen-year old, inspired by a father who fought long and hard for his dignity, sadly loses the battle to convince an automaton world the worth of foreign thoughts and feelings. Yet even though her beliefs are now voiced from a collective conscience, a body now tucked underneath an assembly line figure, we still hear echoes of a rebel crying out.","Have you ever read Shakespeare? Or Keats? Or Shelley? My father gave them to me and lots of others. Aristotle. Socrates. Dosteovsky. Did you know Dosteovsky was an epileptic? He was ugly. He was deformed.

Only a recent bride remains at his side, still keeping the promise of their wedding day. So on a Wild West showdown at high noon, a weary marshal and loyal wife exhibit core values of justice, devotion, courage, and love, more qualities than a tin star can represent.","Yeah, it's a good life! You risk your skin catching killers and the jury turns them loose so they can come back to shoot at you again. If you're honest, you pour your whole life. And in the end, you wind up dying all alone on some dirty street. For what? For nothing, for a tin star...It figures. It's all happens too sudden. People gotta talk themselves into law and order before they do anything about it. Maybe because deep down, they don't care. They just don't care.",MarshallKane.jpg
66,Mother in Black Christ,"The old, aging relic, reticent, uncomplaining and ever so patient who endured a lifetime of woes but still holds steadfastly to her saving faith. Marred by anguished experiences, broken down by troubling relationships, this poor mother still showers warmth and gentleness to a cold, bitter world. She knits by candlelight through weak eyes, threading with wrinkled hands, attached to frail limbs on a weary body frame. Gray hair and woe-ravaged eyes that tell of a crippled, soul-torn Negro story. And when a son is lynched and dies, this woman, Job's darker sister, embraces God with tremendous faith and patience.

Mr. Smith tries to advance the people's business in the nation's capital. But his idealism, common goodness, is stopped dead in its tracks by the political machines, filibusters, the press, gridlock, and back room power dealing. Mr. Smith learns betrayal for political maneuvering; defacto events over hollow words of the founding fathers; money and power over love thy neighbor principles. But through the articles and amendments, Mr. Smith fights for a lost cause, embodying America's true promise.","I guess this is just another lost cause, Mr. Paine. All you people don't know about lost causes. Mr. Paine does. He said once they were the only causes worth fighting for. And he fought for them once, for the only reason any man ever fights for them; because of just one plain simple rule: 'Love thy neighbor'. And in this world today, full of hatred, a man who knows that one rule has a great trust. You know that rule, Mr. Paine, and I loved you for it, just as my father did.  And you know that you fight for the lost causes harder than for any other. Yes, you even die for them.",MrSmith.jpg

But the hard-luck Mulder, who never quits, has a stable, scientifically-minded partner that keeps him sane and keeps him going. Yet deep down in the mist of distrustful institutions and agendas, he carries a soul continually crying out: ""I want to believe.""","I'm the key figure in an ongoing government charade, the plot to conceal the truth about the existence of extraterrestrials.

I wait in momentary expectation, feeling as though my breasts are being crushed, for the sound in the corridor of the footsteps of happiness. Empty. Oh, life is too painful, the reality that confirms the universal belief that it is best not to be born.",Kazuko.jpg
107,Olga Treskovna,"The unknown hidden talent born and raised in a dusty Pennsylvania coal mining town. Olga fights her way into Hollywood show business, appreciating any luck along the way. With a twinkle spark in a star, a spirit of song and smiles, Olga never forgot where she came from. Playing the role of a revolutionary, godly crusader, Olga herself becomes a crusader for the meek: the tired brood of her people in a dusty coal town. The kind, beautiful unknown actress even gives her life for an ideal beyond herself. And when death seems to close the door, bury her story and talent in a vault, Olga's spirit lives on to create miracles. Rest in peace, Olga, among the meek in that promised land where all stories are told and never forgotten.","I hope it's true. Because I didn't play Joan alone. A lot of people played her, people you never seen or heard: my dad, and all the other poor, sad people of Coaltown...I want you to know it and remember why I did it, why I kept on...it's because of all those poor people, all those people I came from who have hopes and dreams in them and never get a chance. They just work and die and all the nice things inside them never come out. And Bill, I came out of them. When they hear me, they'll know it's their own hearts speaking. When they see my name shining in all the theaters, it will be something of theirs shining. Oh, Bill, I'm very happy. I did my job.",OlgaTreskovna.jpg
108,Joey Crown,"The small town New York musician who battles hopelessness and purposelessness. Joey Crown only has a beloved trumpet and a bottle to get through the days. Broke and broken, an aimless alcoholic nobody without a girlfriend, prospects, rotting away in a crummy one-roomer with dirty walls and cracked pipes. Little wonder he can pour out his soul in a brass instrument and make audiences cry. Sure Joey had enough and stepped off a curb but a second chance gave him purpose and direction again, an empty life filled with space and volume. Even in his catharsis we believe the hard luck among us can catch a break, win in the end even if that end is when Gabriel blows his horn."," Because I'm sad. Because I'm nothing. Because I'll live and die in a crummy one-roomer with dirty walls and cracked pipes and I don't even have a girl. I'm going to be a nobody whose half of me is this horn. I can't even talk to people, Baron, because this horn -- that's half my language. But when I'm drunk, Baron...oh, when I'm drunk, boy...I don't see the dirty walls or the cracked pipes. I don't know the clock's going, that the hours are going by. 'Cause then I'm Gabriel. I'm...I'm Gabriel with the golden horn. And when I put it to my lips, it comes out jeweled. Comes out a symphony. Comes out the smell of...fresh flowers in summer. Comes out beauty. Beauty. When I'm drunk, Baron. Only when I'm drunk.",JoeyCrown.jpg
109,Sun Bak,"An expert-trained martial artist with a soft, inner core. Betrayed by family, abandoned by friends, daily attacked in a prison, Sun endures with a gentle, fighting spirit. She helps impossible odds around the world and surmounts the evils, the bullies, the snakes. Even on a hard-bent focus for revenge, friends in spirit help her see the way. A revolutionary at heart, a romantic deep within, we no longer question if a fist, a jab, a hook, a kick is a harder blow than the heart and mind. With Sun Bak on the frontlines, there indeed is nothing more mightier than the meek. And fighting for the nameless and faceless, the meek together can inherit the earth",,SunBak.jpg
110,Morph,"Anyone who wonders if superheros are frail, that courage with superpowers is fragile, that fear incarnate can shape a soul, look no further than Morph. The jokester shapeshifter was a crucial member of a team. Then in a heartbeat became an abandoned, throwaway character. And since then Morph fought his way back from nightmares of sentinels all alone. Yes, his confidence is shaky. Yes, in crucial moments of combat, he froze. And yes, he may never trust his mental fortitude completely. But no, this estranged X-Men is not a loser. He won the hearts and minds of any human or mutant who beat hard odds, stayed true to themselves, stared Fear itself in the face and survived.",,Morph.jpg
111,Mariner,"Only a metaphor for a larger theme but the hopeless character comes to life in the opening stanza. For we all could see the mariner, the weary, stranded, drifting lost soul in the depths of a wide sea. We all pushed on in the dark, all alone, hoping to find that harbor of friendship and love. The unnamed mariner embodies the numbed anguish of loneliness, the despondent desire for something else. His ship-wrecked woe, his brooding tortured soul, his fateful demise encompasses the tragic human condition of the meek. Mute and longing, he drowns in the darkness but still hopes while sinking into the limitless deep -a fire that no water could put out.","He is ever drifted on/ O'er the unreposing wave/To the haven of the grave./What, if there no friends will greet;/What, if there no heart will meet/His with love's impatient beat;/Wander wheresoe'er he may,/Can he dream before that day/To find refuge from distress/In friendship's smile, in love's caress?",Mariner.jpg
112,Desmond Hume,"The English-Scotsman who tried everything to prove himself a good man. As a monk, in the army, running a race around the world, pushing a button every 108 minutes for 3 long years in an underground vault on a mysterious island, Desmond tried and tried. And in his trials and tribulations, in all his sincerity, he did win the love of a faithful, loyal woman. But still lost in time and space, enduring dangers and risks, Desmond keeps on trying to reunite a lost heart with a found one. Aye, we all were once penniless and broken, fighting to prove our worth with only love to keep us going. So Desmond's story is one of the commoner's, and makes him indeed our brother.",,DesmondHume.jpg
113,Warehouse Worker,"The warehouse city worker who sits at his desk and keeps a long, abstracted gaze outside the window, day in and day out. So calm, so steadfast, tinged with quiet, accepting sadness even captures the wonderment of neighbors across the street. Amidst the din and chaos of daily hustle and bustle, the many thousand/million peopled traffic, all the sights and sounds, the nameless warehouse worker never flinches or waivers, stirs or moves. Nothing of interest catches his eye. No angry or joyous thought changes his expression. He just sits and states in somber brooding. His epic silence and mysterious looks seems to imbibe all the throe and woe of the human condition, of human thought and feeling, and does so loud and clear.","'Child, child', it said, 'have patience and belief, for life is many days, and each present hour will pass away...we who have stormed the ramparts of the furious earth and been hurled back, we who have been maddened by the unknowable and bitter mystery of love, we who have hungered after fame and savoured all of life, the tumult, pain, and frenzy, and now sit quietly by our windows watching all that henceforth never more shall touch us...We have outlived the shift and glitter of so many fashions, we have seen so many things that come and go, so many words forgotten, so many flames that flared and were destroyed; yet we know now we are strangers whose footfalls have not left a print upon the endless streets of life. We shall not go into the dark again, nor suffer madness, nor admit despair: we have built a wall about us now. We shall not strike against the wall at night and cry no more! We shall not hear the docks of time strike out on foreign air, nor wake at morning in some alien land to think of home: our wandering is over, and our hunger fed. O brother, son, and comrade, because we have lived so long and seen so much, we are content to make our own a few things now, letting millions pass.'",WarehouseWorker.jpg
114,Oscar de León,"The young hombre who find himself a misfit for being born. A nerd, overweight kid from New Jersey who never had a chance and wanted what all raging, hormonal Western boy wants: action-packed comics; imaginative thrilling sci-fi fantasy; the soft, tender touch of a female peer; the cool respect of male cliques. Oscar got a little of the former, but not much of the latter. The second-generation Dominican tries to go on somehow through the high school, college, career years. But with family curses above, a tragic island story behind, suicidal attempts over a bridge, a minority enclave all around, friends, sister, mother could not save the hard-luck kid. The frustrated Oscar dies for that little bit of normalcy, the touch and taste, all the regular world knows but not his meek kind.",So this is what everybody's always talking about! Diablo! If only I'd known. The beauty! The beauty!,OscarDeLeon.jpg
115,Mr. Gruffydd,"The recent university-educated preacher who joins the Welsh coal mining town with a heart and spirit ready to lead a chapel and community. Along the way, he mentors a child with an unfortunate accident, ordains a wedding and funeral, guides a weary, bitter flock, and falls in love. But Mr. Gruffyd keeps his heart in his work and God, denying his human side. And yet unfortunately, the inspired, young preacher meets the hard, superstitious, fearful, black ignorance of religious zealots who knows all the laws but not the love. Eventually, a now broke-hearted, weary preacher, Mr. Gruffyd must leave giving up the Alexander-charged army for golden truth. But for a time, Mr. Gruffydd was part of the last greenery before the black coal dust descended on the village","Huw, I thought when I was a young man that I would conquer the world with truth. I thought I would lead an army greater than Alexander ever dreamed of, not to conquer nations, but to liberate mankind. With truth. With the golden sound of the Word. But only a few of them heard. Only a few of you understood. The rest of you put on black and sat in Chapel. Why do you come here? Why do you dress your hypocrisy in black and parade before your God on Sunday? From love? No. For you have shown that your hearts are too withered to receive the love of your Divine Father. I know why you have come - I have seen it in your faces Sunday after Sunday as I've stood here before you. Fear has brought you here. Horrible, superstitious fear. Fear of divine retribution - a bolt of fire from the skies. The vengeance of the Lord and the justice of God. But you have forgotten the love of Jesus. You disregard His sacrifice.",MrGruffydd.jpg
116,Rick Blaine,"The jaded club owner in a foreign country caught up in war-torn times, desperate people, and crime infestation in every corner, Rick Blaine is a weary expatriate with a broken heart. And even as time goes by, he wants to mind his own business and let the world war rage on. But then an old love stirs his dead embers of a heart, reminding him of love-filled times in Paris that ended in a rainy moment at a train station. Yet color, light, even purpose begins filling in him. He finds closure to his heartbreak and now aims to save lives across continents, siding with the Allies. Rick no longer dwells in the past but keeps it as a token and treasure even if little peoples' lives don't amount to a hill of beans in a crazy world.",,RickBlaine.jpg
117,"Singer, I Ain't Got No Home","The hard-luck John Doe, dispossessed and disenfranchised, struggling to make ends meet in a sea-widening world of rich and poor. A wandering worker trying to find the breadcrumbs of livelihood; a farmer with paltry returns on yields, the singer is a weary, lone soul who loses the little he had from the storms of the economy. And the police, a banker, the rich man make the road a little bit longer and the load a little bit harder. Then the narrator tells of brothers and sisters trying their luck elsewhere to no avail, and a poor wife who passes away. Our luckless, hapless hero, poor little guy, show us the savage jungle our garden Earth can be with its peopled systems and that life is hard and then you die.","I ain't got no home, I'm just a-roamin' 'round,/ Just a wandrin' worker, I go from town to town./ And the police make it hard wherever I may go/ And I ain't got no home in this world anymore./ Was a-farmin' on the shares, and always I was poor;/ My crops I lay into the banker's store./ My wife took down and died upon the cabin floor,/ And I ain't got no home in this world anymore./ ...Now as I look around, it's mighty plain to see/ This world is such a great and a funny place to be;/ Oh, the gamblin' man is rich an' the workin' man is poor,/ And I ain't got no home in this world anymore.",SingerIAintGotNoHome.jpg
118,"Singer, Piano Man","The musician who plays for the derelicts and strays, the hopeless and mundane of the world, the lost and lonely on a Saturday night. The piano man comes to be the only color to their dull lives, reminding the old of a lost youth, the failures of old ambitions, the lonesomeness of a small company. And in his rhythmic crooning and piano strokes, the piano man himself is part of the meek bar crowd. He too knows and feels and sings away abandoned hours, heartsick blues, life ever after for the has-beens and left-outs. Who knew music could bring together a hard-luck people? Indeed if ever misery loves company, for a span in time and space it did so with the power of music.","Now Paul is a real estate novelist/ Who never had time for a wife/ And he's talkin' with Davy, who's still in the Navy/ And probably will be for life/ And the waitress is practicing politics/ As the businessmen slowly get stoned/ Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness/ But it's better than drinkin' alone/ Sing us a song you're the piano man/ Sing us a song tonight/ Well we're all in the mood for a melody/ And you got us feeling alright",SingerPianoMan.jpg
119,Mr. Kaplan,"The cleaner who was a faithful, dutiful servant with one goal held firmly to the end. And when a fork in the road made it time to choose, Mr. Kaplan held resolute in her convictions. A sweet, endearing nanny to a child she held on as a quiet protector. But for her firm oath, Kate was gunned down and left for dead in an empty field. Poor Mr. Kaplan who cleaned up so many dead bodies nearly became one herself all because she obeyed an old promise that required disobeying a new one. Mr. Kaplan stayed on in the shadows of a criminal empire: sacrificing, denying herself, losing loved ones along the way. And at another fork in the road, Mr. Kaplan leaped into the abyss, ending the endless questions of good or evil, friend or foe, hero or villain?",,MrKaplan.jpg
120,"Old Man in Dark in the Forest, Strange As Time","The genial spirit who spent his last hours on a train in Germany conversing with a stranger. Warm-spirited, heavy-accented the dying old man exchanges politely and passionately in a human moment. Seeking health, departing from a loved one, curiously questioning of the who-where-when, the elderly man is a mysterious interesting fellow. But we see his world-weariness, all the long miles trekked in his soul. He sits in contrast to the hot-tempered, blood-roaring, excited young man he talks with on the train. Where his conversational companion hungers for all the rivers, hills, fields, towns, cities, peoples, the old man wants just one: one life, one time, one place. After passing quietly away, he teaches us that in all of life a little is enough.","You are very young. Yes. Now, you vant to see it all and to haf it all -but you haf nothing. Zat is right -Yes? Zat vill all change. Some day you vill vant only a little -maybe, then, you haf a little. And dat iss better -Yes? I know. I know. Myself, I had gone everyvere like you.

One field, one hill, rifer...zat iss enough!...One life, one place, one time.",OldManDarkInTheForestStrangeAsTime.jpg
121,"Singer, Amazing Grace","The lost, blind wretch who found his way because of grace alone. He has witnessed a catharsis of heavenly proportion; an inspiration of unreal breadth and depth; an awakening that transforms a soul. We too partake in the wholesome change. Forever now humble and earnest, good and kind, the singer accepts and understands it all. He has let faith seep into his pores and now is kept from snares and dangers to come as he is lead home. He embraces a loving Lord. He sees without the eyes. He sings beyond the words. Northing of this world can break his faith now as he surmounts any hard odds. Now with shield he goes on, meek and pure, teaching us meekness is more than a state of being but mind and spirit.","Amazing grace! How sweet the sound/ That saved a wretch like me!/ I once was lost, but now am found;/ Was blind, but now I see./ 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,/ And grace my fears relieved;/ How precious did that grace appear/ The hour I first believed.",SingerAmazingGrace.jpg
122,Mother in Free At Last,"The dying mother finally relieved of her heartache life. She tells her son on a deathbed of her long-sought freedom in passionate eloquence. Too hard she endured a cursed, rebuked, and scorned life. She raised a son, struggling in a family after a father died. Now she exclaims: “”I'm going home.”” Her love no doubt will live on as she happily ends her earthly appointment. We feel her pain subsides, her tears forever wiped away, her trials and tribulations a remote past, her troubles over. Any infirm, sick, dying, aged can welcome her story. Any healthy, vibrant, hopeful, young can understand her relief. And all meek souls here and after can know a sweet relief will come; and a carnal world will not imprison for long beautiful souls.","I've been cursed, I've been scorned/ I've been talked about sure as you're born./ I've seen men kicked around/ With their head down to the ground/ But I'm free at last./ ...I have lived my life down here/ Having her child down through the years/ But I got to leave you alone/ But you got to be real strong and carry on/ But I'm free at last...Son, don't know I'm free.

123,John Reese,"A soldier to the very end, John Reese transformed from a purposeless vagabond to the man in the suit who saves lives with mission calls from an AI entity. Expert-trained special forces operative John endured the blackest of high-order secretive crimes. And years later he becomes a lost soul: no home or family, no spouse or friend, no job to return to, no peace within from raging war lands. He did though find his calling in protecting the helpless and innocent on a subway train. From there the man in the suit goes on to fight for more nameless out there under the surveillance of a machine. And at the crossroads, John protects to the very end, giving his life for the cause and raises the 21st century question: can a machine have a soul like a human?",,JohnReese.jpg
124,Bud Bundy,"The little guy who is the level-head in a dysfunctional family, Bud is laughed at and teased for his romantic mistrials. He always tries hard to impress a girl he can never win. But Bud stands tall and mighty for all the other little guys out there, all the misfits who live in one-roomers and basements but tries hard in school, at work, in public spaces. College-bound Bud makes it out on his own despite the setbacks, the letdowns, the bullies, the insults and injuries. His tragic situations even carry comedic undertones but America sees a cast-out boy trying hard to prove himself a man even long after he already claimed the title. No one who knows Bud's hard-luck story can claim size makes a man.",,BudBundy.jpg
125,Shawn Hunter,"The hard-luck kid from the other side of the tracks. Never grew up in a stable, two-parent, middle class home like his long-time buddy, Shawn Hunter is a survivor. Good with the ladies, fights off the bullies, average in the grades, Shawn is the leather-jacket, slick-talking, seat-slouching higher schooler with a good heart. We see Shawn growing up from a junior high kid to a collage young man torn between the bad boy image to the faithful nice guy. But the road was tough with absent father, troubled mother, long-lost brother, always proving something to the world and himself, and always fighting off peer pressure and emotional bullies. And so without surprise the restless kid laments on the big stage at graduation time, “”I could have done better.””",,ShawnHunter.jpg
126,Father Connolly,"Once a childhood troublemaker and partner to a budding hoodlum, then turned to a priest fighting the impossible fight against a corrupt city racket for the sake of neighborhood kids. Father Connolly tried it all to save slum kids from crime with recreation sports to a church choir. But his own childhood friend discourages the process but might be the only saving, redeeming grace to help the cause. Torn between the gray continuum of morality, friendship, duty, Father Connolly held firm to his heavenly convictions. He mustered the courage born in heaven to save lost youth who worshiped the wrong kid of heroes. And he learned to beat the power machine and hoodlums one must become an angel with a dirty face.",,FatherConnolly.jpg
127,"Singer, Walk With You","The angelic voice that knows all too well earthly trials and tribulations. And no matter what road her companion treads or what load they bear, the speaker promises to walk alongside her friend. With an unconditional love to endure the nights and even face death itself, the voice rings a chorus and refrain strong and true. She promises with ceaseless affirmations to the longest mile, through grayest day. No more suffering in loneliness, in heartache, in misfortune, misery or suffering. And from the bottom pits of that woe, our heroine welcomes the magic of human companionship. And if we listeners ever doubt the voice that no one will truly walk with us in our darkest times, we are yet reminded over and over again by the singer: “”Yes I will.””","When you walk down the road/ Heavy burden, heavy load/ I will rise and I will walk with you/ When you walk through the night/ And you feel like you want to just give up, give up, give up on the fight/ I will come and I will walk with you/ Walk with you/ Until the sun don't even shine/ Walk with you/ I'll be there all the time/ I tell you I'll walk with you/ See you through/ When you walk from this place/ And you gotta go to meet Him face to face/ Take my hand and I will walk with you",SingerWalkWithYou.jpg
128,"Singer, Changes","He wakes in the morning and asks the life and death question. The hard-luck young black man whose life has been cut across by the concrete divide of inequality. Frustrated, confused, soul exasperated the singer pours out rhymes to make sense of a senseless existence. Poverty walls him around. Police barricades his life outcomes. Prisons are a certain future. And still he sings about potential changes with no strangers, drug dealers, gang bangers; no systematic hate, racism, or evil, only heaven healing and the simple times of childhood. And we only hope things can change and weary souls can lean back at ease. But we know too our hero will be another statistic striving to change the world and die trying.",And still I see no changes can't a brother get a little peace/ It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East/ Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs/ So the police can bother me/ And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do/...And I never get to lay back/ 'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs/ Some buck that I roughed up way back/ Comin' back after all these years/ Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat that's the way it is uhh,SingerChanges.jpg
129,"Speaker, For Annie","Finally, he rests at ease. Finally, the thirst is quenched, the moaning and groaning, the sighing and sobbing are over. We even feel the relief in our own limbs from his words. Where some people lead content lives, all hungers assuaged, all loved ones near, this speaker had it hard, bore a load of the soul. Death gave him a cure to the sickness. And though the living dread the state of passing away, the speaker welcomes it deeply and joyously, pillowing his fevered, maddened head on the heavenly breast of a long, lost love. Oh what a sweet, composed, delicious sleep our anguished friend enjoys now near the sound of tranquil waters with only love as his eternal essence.","Thank Heaven! the crisis,/ The danger, is past,/ And the lingering illness/ Is over at last—/ And the fever called ""Living""/ Is conquered at last./ ...The moaning and groaning,/ The sighing and sobbing,/ Are quieted now,/ With that horrible throbbing/ At heart:—ah, that horrible,/ Horrible throbbing!/ ...The sickness—the nausea—/ The pitiless pain—/ Have ceased, with the fever/ That maddened my brain—/ With the fever called ""Living""/ That burned in my brain./ And oh! of all tortures/ That torture the worst/ Has abated—the terrible/ Torture of thirst/ For the naphthaline river/ Of Passion accurst:—/ I have drank of a water/ That quenches all thirst:—",SpeakerForAnnie.jpg
130,Miss Martian,"The lovable alien from a sister planet who joins a teenage superhero team to fight for justice. But Miss Martian with unbelievable power of telekinesis, flight, shape and density shifting is a torn, meek soul. She grew up in a lonely childhood with an old-time TV series to give her inspiration. And she bears the scars of an oppressed minority white Martian at odds with green Martians. Even too she bears the burden of keeping her hideous, true form from the world and her friends. Yet Miss Martian soon learns love conquers all and friendship, romance, family, heroism are the real powers one can have where all else pales in comparison.",,MissMartian.jpg
131,Boo Radley,"Barricaded in his dark home in a provincial-minded Alabama town, Boo Radley becomes the mysterious interest of neighborhood kids. Boo Radley is never seen or heard, coming or going and so whispers and gossips abound. All the dark epithets hurl his way. If chosen, this county in the South would elect Boo Radley as the perfect candidate for the title of modern day creep. Yet despite it all, Boo exchanges gifts and kindness and even stands up for the children on his block, be it life or death. So while courtrooms decide on continued hate, towns carry on in their ignorance, a southern people their myopia, a nameless recluse from nowhere teaches ""love thy neighbor"" principles.",,BooRadley.jpg
132,Black Widow,"The trained human weapon used for espionage, intelligence, re-con, combat, and nothing else. Since childhood, Black Widow fought her way across continents and allegiances. Just where the law stops, vengeance and justice begins, Natasha doesn't know. She doesn't even remember being abducted as a child, if she was really to excel as a ballerina in a different life. But for now, she fights on against the villains of the world, joining an assembly of other heroes. Acrobatic in moves, astute in martial arts, keen in spy tactics, Black Widow makes peace with her situation and her nature. The past would be a villain she beats alongside the present, the real hero.",,BlackWidow.jpg
133,Charlie Brown,"America and the world's lovable loser, Charlie Brown is the iconic archetype of the average kid. He leads his Peanuts gang in their everyday antics: the highs and lows of kid play. But Charlie is not the hero of stardom; he carries no badge of distinction or plaques for the wall, trophies for the mantle. He just carries rejections, frustrations, defeats, and so carries the hearts of millions just like him: naive, cynical, hapless sometimes, excited other times. We quietly root for this underdog. We want him to win the feat, beat the odds, stand tall and mighty before the crowds - just once. But we know Life dealt him and us a different hand and he never wins. But finally, a little guy got his face in the newspaper.",,CharlieBrown.jpg
134,"Singer, Running on Empty","The singer gives us the enduring chorus of modern times. Echoing the confusion and unassuaged numbness through the years and places, roads and fields, the singer reminds us all of our own hungers, yearnings, lost loves and lost days, our emptiness. He reminisces of bygone childhood moments in the carefree long ago, chasing horizons. But now the landscapes have changed. The routine of adulthood sets in. Our stifled souls don't know how to express the void. But the singer still looks to friends and love's smile to pull him through with hope beyond hope to survive the distances and times. Yes, he shows us that even a glass half empty can still quench a soul's thirst.","Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels/ Looking back at the years gone by like so many summer fields/ In sixty-five I was seventeen and running up one-oh-one/ I don't know where I'm running now, I'm just running on/ Running on, running on empty/ Running on, running blind/ Running on, running into the sun/ But I'm running behind/ Gotta do what you can just to keep your love alive/ Trying not to confuse it with what you do to survive/ In sixty-nine I was twenty-one and I called the road my own/ I don't know when that road turned, into the road I'm on/...Looking out at the road rushing under my wheels/ I don't know how to tell you all just how crazy this life feels Look around for the friends that I used to turn to to pull me through/ Looking into their eyes I see them running too",SingerRunningOnEmpty.jpg
135,Beetle Bailey,"The quintessence of the average GI Joe, the freckled, hapless, goof-off, perpetual shirker, Beetle Bailey makes his way through the drills and regiment and structure of an army training camp. Always bombarded by authority heads and insane rules, Beetle survives somehow. We little guys caught in our own mundane routine can see a little bit of ourselves in Beetle Bailey. We too want a break from bureaucracy and procedures. We too want simplicity in a chaotic world. We too joke in quiet hours with our rag tag friends. So Beetle is a refreshing mirror to our everyday selves and gladly we will march alongside and fight with him in that larger camp called Life.",,BeetleBailey.jpg
136,"Singer, Sexual Healing","A sweet, aching voice penetrating the darkness, the singer finds healing in love-making. When the blue teardrops fall, when the waves rise and rise, when emotional stability fades, he finds a balm in Gilead with intimacy. For so long intercourse carried every connotation, good or bad, but hardly one of healing for all the shivering, lonely souls out there. No more the stormy skies, sick mornings with a loved one a phone call away. Our singer in soulful eloquence paints the magic of two humans exchanging in a natural human moment, the love-spirit in the flesh. The music that can heal any who ever claimed in the end: ""cause I'm all alone"".",,SingerSexualHealing.jpg
137,"Singer, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For","Echoing from highest heights to soul's depths, the singer's voice embodies all the surreal yearning, wonder, ache, and hope that can be contained in the human vessel. With spiritual searching, the singer moves between the continuum of angels and devils. He tried and tried up mountains, through the fields, up city walls, through the night and is still running. What does he look for in painstaking earnestness? It can only be a thing with no name: a peace, solace, absolution, salvation, love ever after, kingdom to come. And as we yield and submit to the cosmos, our own unsuccessful searching mirrors much like the singer's who still roams the night when others sleep looking for the unknown, unnamed substance not found on Earth.","I believe in the Kingdom come/ Then all the colors will bleed into one/ Bleed into one/ But yes, I'm still running/ You broke the bonds/ and you loosened chains/ carried the cross of my shame, of my shame/ You know I believe it/ But I still haven't found/ What I'm looking for",SingerIStillHaventFoundWhatImLookingFor.jpg
138,"Singer, Tha Crossroads","The grieving, turmoiled spirit caught up in a thug's life and hoping to follow God 24/7. But the everyday crimes tear away at the singer. He is pushed and pulled, yanked and dragged back and forth in his moral compass. His environment, his family, and friends, the violence all around, his life's chances forces the singer on an ill-fated destiny. And deep down his faith keeps him going. And he knows in the hereafter there is no mercy for him and his kind. He survived the jungle to be doomed for eternity with tears of pain in between. And still he questions and broods for the answer beyond the reason of his grief. And the only reply he can hear back is: ""we live to die.""","Follow the Lord all 24/7 days/ God is who we praise/ Even though the Devil's all up in my face/ But He keepin' me safe and in my place/ Say grace to the gates we race/ Without a chance to face the judge/ Then I guess my soul won't budge/ Grudge, because there's no mercy for thugs/ Ooh, what could I do?/ It's all about a family and how we roll/ Can I get a witness? Let it unfold/ We livin' our lives to eternal our souls...Livin' in a hateful world/ Sendin' me (straight to Heaven)/ That's how we roll/ And I asked the good Lord why/ And inside, he told me we live to die",SingerThaCrossroads.jpg
139,"Speaker, I'm Nobody! Who are You?","The perky little voice who doesn't mind being forgotten, nameless, infinitesimal. The speaker invites us to relish one's unnamed self who never sees the limelight, the spotlight, the newspaper headlines, the viral video. Happily relinquishing the worthless things of this world, the speaker is a reassuring and refreshing voice. Where everyone runs for the stampede of fame and fortune, status and inner circles, the speaker stands by the wayside reaching out a hand to the left-behinds and left-outs. She even amuses us on the worthless things of this world called a human name with no more currency than mud or a bog. She begs us to keep the title of Nobody as if the meek who inherit the world will do so quietly, unpublished.",I'm Nobody! Who are you?/ Are you – Nobody – too?/ Then there's a pair of us!/ Don't tell! they'd advertise – you know!/ How dreary – to be – Somebody!/ How public – like a Frog –  / To tell one's name – the livelong June – / To an admiring Bog!,SpeakerImNobodyWhoAreYou.jpg
140,"Singer, Tears in Heaven","The pleading voice who asks no more but to be remembered by name, to hold a hand in heaven. Accompanied by the rhythmic plucking of guitar strings, the singer's sad, gentle, weary crooning shakes the fiber of any conscious being. He is ever so restless, believing heaven is not for him. And that he must continue onward night and day for his true belonging, for the peace everlasting where there is no pain or tears. He rightfully affirms the gravity hard truth of earthly life that time can break you down. Can we squeeze the singer's shoulders? Can we stop his restless soul from wandering? Can we tell him if he would believe us that it is only him and his kind who ever belonged in heaven?",Would you know my name/ If I saw you in heaven?/ Would it be the same/ If I saw you in heaven?/ I must be strong and carry on/ 'Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven/ Would you hold my hand/ If I saw you in heaven?/ Would you help me stand/ If I saw you in heaven?/ I'll find my way through night and day/ 'Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven,SingerTearsInHeaven.jpg
141,"Singer, Operator","Heartbreak's living incarnate voice, the singer carries the heaviness and pain of a lost modern day romance. As he talks to the telephone operator for a little contact number to prove his bravado and muster against an estranged beau and friend we feel his pain reverberate with plucked guitar strings. And it hurts all the more with the real thing -a love that would save the singer. We all were in his shoes once who saw our loved one steal off into the sunset. We fought back the tears. We denied or minimized the true effect. We tried the words to beat how we feel. The singer unites us all with our shared pain. He even becomes our hero to calmly surrender the need to prove himself to his ex-lover and does so in music.",,SingerOperator.jpg
142,"Speaker, O Me! O Life!","The exasperated voice who sees his infinitesimal self in the broader, larger scope of cities and universe. Defeated, he sees the crowds, the trains, cities, and debases himself lower among the multitude. What does it all mean? What do I do now? Where shall I go? These are the silent questions asked but never answered. And then he sees the years recurring before and after and all the waste and wear of the human soul: lost days, unachieved goals, vain body of work, the aching mind. And then he hears a voice, learns a lesson of enough, of being small in an enormous existence -that to leave a crumb, a trace, a verse is still worthwhile.","Oh me! Oh life! of the questions of these recurring,/ Of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities fill'd with the foolish,/ Of myself forever reproaching myself, (for who more foolish than I, and who more faithless?)/ Of eyes that vainly crave the light, of the objects mean, of the struggle ever renew'd,/ Of the poor results of all, of the plodding and sordid crowds I see around me, Of the empty and useless years of the rest, with the rest me intertwined,/ The question, O me! so sad, recurring—What good amid these, O me, O life?",SpeakerOMeOLife.jpg
143,Boy in The Carrot Seed,"A tenacious, ever hopeful, ever persistent boy who kept on believing with no encouraging proof. Even when everyone near and dear told him a simple carrot seed will not come up the boy who listened intently to every word still believed otherwise. And didn't just sit and wait but worked. He pulled, tended, watered that plant. If ever there was a living testimony to human perseverance this is the story. We know it is not just a carrot seed but all the hard-earned, striving goals, tangible and intangible, of this world and the next. And this isn't just any boy but a symbol of the best in the human spirit. Our boy is a hero who beat the naysayers with patience and resolve who hoped beyond hope and hard enough to create a miracle.",,BoyTheCarrotSeed.jpg
144,"Speaker, Forgiveness","Heavy-hearted, broken-spirited the anguished speaker finds himself walking the burial grounds. He comes to see the inevitable end of all humans, the threshold crossed and never returned. He learns the transience of it all, the vanity of all works and acts. And through this catharsis, studying the abyss, his pride shatters. With such revelation what worth can there be to hold grudges, that our visit on earth is too short for pointless trifles where wronged and wrongdoer end in the same fate. Yes, the speaker broke his pride and forgave, finding it better to sink in the grave with brotherly, neighborly spirit than burdened with pointless petty earthly cares.","Where, pondering how all human love and hate/ Find one sad level; and how, soon or late,/ Wronged and wrongdoer, each with meekened face,/ And cold hands folded over a still heart,/ Pass the green threshold of our common grave,/ Whither all footsteps tend, whence none depart,/ Awed for myself, and pitying my race,/ Our common sorrow, like a mighty wave,/ Swept all my pride away, and trembling I forgave!",SpeakerForgiveness.jpg
145,"Speaker, Ode to a Nightingale","Entranced by a bird's singing but anguished in state of mind, the speaker vacillates between reality and revelry. He uses the nightingale as a symbol of a better world, far past and beyond the death and pain in purity and song. He even wishes to flee with the nightingale away from the race of men in the very essence of Poetry. So long has he brooded and romanticized Death itself. Rising and falling, ebbing and flowing in wonderment, anticipation, weariness and longing, the speaker pours onto the bird a soulful introspection. But reality kicks in and the dream ends. But it seems a part of the speaker may have flown away.","Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget/ What thou among the leaves hast never known,/ The weariness, the fever, and the fret/ Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;/ Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,/ Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;/ Where but to think is to be full of sorrow/ And leaden-eyed despairs,/ Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,/ Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.",SpeakerOdeToANightingale.jpg
146,"Speaker, Tao Te Ching, 20","Completely destitute of all things, the speaker pours out a dirge to the world. Everyone around filled with purpose, life, bounty, busy enjoying life, the speaker finds himself naked in atomic nullity with no place to go, nothing to do, no one for him. Stripped of all worldly things he thinks of himself as a newborn -mute, dumb, empty- and the pain of such emptiness transmutes to confusion, frustration, restlessness. He drifts on nowhere like the waves and wind. All in stark contrast to everyone else he seems to be dying in the lost days and time. But the anguished speaker learns a valuable lesson that in his emptiness he nourishes on something of the soul, gaining true enlightenment.","Other people are contented, enjoying the sacrificial feast of the ox./ In spring some go to the park, and climb the terrace,/ But I alone am drifting not knowing where I am./ Like a new-born babe before it learns to smile,/ I am alone, without a place to go./ ...Oh, I drift like the waves of the sea./ Without direction, like the restless wind./ Everyone else is busy,/ But I alone am aimless and depressed./ I am different./ I am nourished by the great mother.",SpeakerTaoTeChing20.jpg
147,"Speaker, The Journey","Onward toward an uncertain journey, the speaker absorbs all the everyday beauties around him -above, below, here and there. Yet sadly no one shares in his momentous wonder of flower and sun. As he stands still all around are people coming and going, no one staying, no one stopping or glancing back: no smile, no song, no look of eye, no human exchange. And later he rests at the scorn of his acquaintances who too do not care for the passing scene and moment. The speaker is a tender, sensitive creature embracing the delicious presence, here and now. He even finds that the journey is neither hard nor long when you walk in the spirit of all things, destined for a human rendezvous.",the wealth of gold was scattered through the rift of the clouds while we busily went on our way and paid no heed. We sang no glad songs nor played; we went not to the village for barter; we spoke not a word nor smiled; we lingered not on the way. We quickened our pace more and more as the time sped by.,SpeakerTheJourney.jpg
148,Jimmy B-Rabbit,"The tortured urban Mid-Westerner who pounded out the anguish of his soul in rap battles. From impoverished settings and meager origins and dismal odds, Jimmy B-Rabbit never had a chance. He fights to keep afloat with blue-collared work. He fights to overcome his trailer park, rundown roots. He fights to command respect among his peers. He fights and fights. And so long running away from his problems and weaknesses, Jimmy eventually embraces them and turns it into ironic puns and beat box punchlines. And if ever a bullying word smith comes to ridicule the poor, the weak, the outcasts, bet your last dollar Jimmy B-Rabbit will be on the scene to fight back and duel the bully until the last Mic drops.",,JimmyBRabbit.jpg
149,"Singer, My Love is Your Love","Singing a love song about the Judgment Day, homelessness, World War III, aging, even death, the singer captures the essence of unconditional love. She paints a love with no ego, no status, no wealth or assets, no success or ambition, just wholly human connection that even the afterlife cannot tear apart. Her lullaby, melodic, tranquil voice carries an accepting understanding as if she seen it all -the mystery of the cosmos, the eventuality of all things, the very face of God. And she finds only love matters -the kind that sleeps on the street and train station with you, ages with you, through all peril and destruction. And living in such moments and spirit is a life well-spent.",If tomorrow is judgement day (sing mommy)/ And I'm standin' on the front line/ And the Lord ask me what I did with my life/ I will say I spent it with you/ If I wake up in World War 3/ I see destruction and poverty/ And I feel like I want to go home/ It's okay if you're comin' with me/… If I lose my fame and fortune/ And I'm homeless on the street/ And I'm sleepin' in Grand Central Station/ It's okay if you're sleepin' with me/ As the years they pass us by/We stay young through each other's eyes/ And no matter how old we get/ It's okay as long as I got you babe,SingerMyLoveIsYourLove.jpg
150,Sephora,"The youngest, last and least daughter cast out among her other sisters in beauty and grace, Sephora is a simple shepherd girl who keeps a gentle, faithful soul in a quiet desert corner of the world. And when compared to woman's beauty, indulgences, and conveniences, Sephora reminds us of the inner beauty: quiet as the green valleys and still waters. Sephora even reminds us of the true, pure love and faith of strong willed people with good values. With her sincere, beautiful spirit by a crusader's side, little wonder miracles triumph and shepherds surmount the power of pharaohs. Any flash and dash, glitter and glow, anything popular and vain, pale to the Sephoras of the old and new world.","A jewel has brilliant fire, but it gives no warmth. Our hands are not so soft, but they can serve. Our bodies not so white, but they are strong. Our lips are not perfumed, but they speak the truth. Love is not an art to us. It's life to us. We are not dressed in gold and fine linen. Strength and honor are our clothing. Our tents are not the columned halls of Egypt, but our children play happily before them. We can offer you little... but we offer all we have.",Sephora.jpg
